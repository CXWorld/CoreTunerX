# CoreTunerX

This tool reads the Windows CPU cores rating from the event viewer and saves them in a text document.
The read out values have no unit and are only used to compare the cores of this one CPU with each other, not with other CPUs.

How to interpret the performance numbers: The higher the score, the higher the priority from the windows sheduler.
